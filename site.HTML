  <p class="example-blue-style">We don't discriminate by species at THIS company. That's right.
    We take any pet from the smallest insect to the biggest water buffalo. Our office is in Brunswick Maine
     and since it is vacationland you can enjoy your vacation without the burden of caring for your pet.</p>
